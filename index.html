      <p class="dark-text contents">Coming from small-ish town Kansas, I was always interested in computers but never had the opprotunity to explore them in school. I was also interested in architecutre, and spent highschool thinking that was going to be my major. While making my college portfolio, I found that I enjoyed more so the technology I used to create art, rather than the actual creation of art itself. After accepting my offer to attend Notre Dame, I decided to switch into Computer Science to follow this passion. When I came to college, I was determined to figure out how computers and technology work, and find a way to contribute to this community.</p>
      <p class="dark-text contents"> My current interests lie in machine leanring. The first project I did that introdued me to CS was a Neural Network, and ever since them I have been fascinated with the field. Since I only started exploring CS in May 2017, I am open to learning anything and have been exposing myself to as many different facets to this field as possible, both inside and outside of class. </p>
